This is a BibLaTeX style that implements the bibliography style
of the IEEE for BibLaTeX. The implementation follows standard
BibLaTeX conventions, and can be used simply by loading
BibLaTeX with the appropriate option:
\usepackage[style=ieee]{biblatex} A demonstration database is
provided to show how to format input for the style.
biblatex-ieee requires BibLaTeX 2.7 or later, and works with
both BibTeX and Biber as the database back-end.
