pkglint checks whether a pkgsrc package conforms to the various
conventions established over the years. It produces warnings, errors and
notes and, upon request, explains them.

Before importing a new package or making changes to an existing package,
pkglint should be run in the package's directory to check for common
errors.

This is the current version of pkglint.  Because it is written in go,
it does not run on all pkgsrc platforms; see also pkglint4.
