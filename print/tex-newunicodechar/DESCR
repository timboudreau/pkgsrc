The package provides a friendly interface for defining the
meaning of Unicode characters. The document should be processed
by (pdf)LaTeX with the unicode option of inputenc or inputenx,
or by XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX. The command provided is
\newunicodechar{<char>}{<code>} where <char> is a
directly-typed Unicode character, and <code> is its
replacement.
