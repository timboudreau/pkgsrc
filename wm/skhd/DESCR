skhd is a simple hotkey daemon for macOS.

skhd is a stripped version of khd (no longer maintained) (although
rewritten from scratch), that sacrifices the more advanced features in
favour of increased responsiveness and performance.  skhd is able to
hotload its config file, meaning that hotkeys can be edited and updated
live while skhd is running.
