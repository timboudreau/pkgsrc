x11perf is a standard X11 tool for measuring how many times per
second a given X11 request can be made.  It also includes the Xmark
script to calculate how many millions of times faster your 2019
GPU is than the graphics on a 1989 SPARCstation 1 workstation, if
you need more meaningless numbers in your life.
