chunkwm has been configured to start with your session.

To get started, copy ${PREFIX}/share/examples/chunkwm/chunkwmrc to
~/.chunkwmrc and edit at will.  The configuration file must be executable.

Once done, launch chunkwm with:

launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.koekeishiya.chunkwm.plist

You should also install skhd, the keyboard daemon to capture key presses
and send commands to chunkwm.
