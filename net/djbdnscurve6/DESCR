djbdnscurve6 is a fork of djbdns combining

- IPv6 capabilities based on fehQlibs allowing the use of compactified
  IPv6 and LLU addresses,
- a CurveDNS secured query/response for dnscache based on NaCl with an
  adapted Matthew Dempsky patch,
- including improvements for CNAME caching, and
- allowing a qualification of DNS Name Servers.
- rbldns supporting now IPv6 addresses.
- tinydns using now compactified IPv6 addresses within the tinydns-data
  data file.

The decrypting djbdnscurve6 stub resolver can be used as standard lib
for other programs.
