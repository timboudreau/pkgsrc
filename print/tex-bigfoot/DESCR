The package aims to provide a 'one-stop' solution to
requirements for footnotes. It offers: Multiple footnote
apparatus superior to that of manyfoot Footnotes can be
formatted in separate paragraphs, or be run into a single
paragraph (this choice may be selected per footnote series);
Things you might have expected (such as \verb-like material in
footnotes, and colour selections over page breaks) now work.
Note that the majority of the bigfoot package's interface is
identical to that of manyfoot; users should seek information
from that package's documentation. The bigfoot bundle also
provides the perpage and suffix packages.
