of nearly all aspects of the underlying BIND architecture.  Some
of the important features of BIND-9 are:

	- DNS Security
	- IP version 6
	- DNS Protocol Enhancements
	- Views
	- Multiprocessor Support
	- Improved Portability Architecture
	- Full NSEC3 support
	- Automatic zone re-signing
	- New update-policy methods tcp-self and 6to4-self

This package contains the BIND 9.12 release.

	  improved query performance.
	- Code implementing the name server query processing logic has been
	  moved into a new libns library.
	- The DNS Response Policy Service API (DNSRPS) is now supported.
	- Log file timestamps can now also be formatted in ISO 8601 (local)
	  or ISO 8601 (UTC) formats.
	- Added support for the EDNS Padding and Keepalive options.
	- 'new-zones-directory' option sets the location where the
	  configuration data for zones added by rndc addzone is stored.
	- The default key algorithm in rndc-confgen is now hmac-sha256.
	- filter-aaaa-on-v4 and filter-aaaa-on-v6 options are now available
	  by default without a configure option.
