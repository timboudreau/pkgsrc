U-Boot is a bootloader for embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and
several other processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application code.

This package provides U-Boot for the Odroid C2 board.

See http://git.denx.de/?p=u-boot.git;a=blob;f=board/amlogic/odroid-c2/README
