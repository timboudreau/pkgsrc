Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is available for
all common and most esoteric platforms and supports many different printers
and some displays.

Support for Cups is enabled by the "cups" option (off by default).

This package contains Ghostscript 9.06, the last Ghostscript release
under GPL3 (August, 2012).  Newer releases are under AGPL3 (see
ghostscript-agpl); this package exists for those that prefer an old
GPL3 version to the AGPL3 version maintained by upstream.
