A Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS),
making cross-origin AJAX possible.

This package has a simple philosophy, when you want to enable CORS, you
wish to enable it for all use cases on a domain. This means no mucking
around with different allowed headers, methods, etc. By default,
submission of cookies across domains is disabled due to the security
implications, please see the documentation for how to enable
credential'ed requests, and please make sure you add some sort of
CSRF protection before doing so!
