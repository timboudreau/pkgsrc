Cliqz develops novel Internet browsers that incorporate features
such as search and anti-tracking. Cliqz desktop browser is based
on Mozilla Firefox.

Cliqz pre-installs the Cliqz add-on, which causes search terms to
be sent to Cliqz as the default search engine. In addition the
HTTPS Everywhere addon is installed, and an addon to manage consent
to data processing.
