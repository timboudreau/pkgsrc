Pepper contains a Python library and CLI scripts for accessing a remote
salt-api instance.

pepperlib abstracts the HTTP calls to salt-api so existing Python projects can
easily integrate with a remote Salt installation just by instantiating a class.

The pepper CLI script allows users to execute Salt commands from computers that
are external to computers running the salt-master or salt-minion daemons as
though they were running Salt locally. The long-term goal is to add additional
CLI scripts maintain the same interface as Salt's own CLI scripts (salt,
salt-run, salt-key, etc).
