Safely store secrets in a VCS repo (i.e. Git, Mercurial, Subversion or
Perforce). These commands make it easy for you to Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)
encrypt specific files in a repo so they are "encrypted at rest" in your
repository. However, the scripts make it easy to decrypt them when you need
to view or edit them, and decrypt them for use in production. Originally
written for Puppet, BlackBox now works with any Git or Mercurial repository.
