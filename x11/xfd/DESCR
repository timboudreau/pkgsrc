xfd is a small gui tool to display all the characters in a font
using either the X11 core protocol or libXft2.

The xfd utility creates a window containing the name of the font
being displayed, a row of command buttons, several lines of text
for displaying character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph
per cell.  The characters are shown in increasing order from left
to right, top to bottom.

This is the version of xfd maintained by Xorg.
